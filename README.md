# 890-II
Custom firmware for Radtel RT-890 PCB V2.1

More surprises to come??

Well, [the old 890 repo](https://github.com/M7OCM/890) is back. The original content required some much needed housekeeping plus I've been focussing on LoRa projects.

I love the RT-890 and use it daily. So watch this space... just waiting on the hardware to arrive to test.

Thanks to Kevin @Radtel

73 for now
