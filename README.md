# 890-II
Custom firmware for Radtel RT-890 PCB V2.1

More surprises to come??

Well, [the old 890 repo](https://github.com/M7OCM/890) will return soon. Not sure when. I've been working on a lot of personal projects.

I love the RT-890 and use it daily. So watch this space...

Thanks to Kevin (Radtel) for the heads up.

73 for now
